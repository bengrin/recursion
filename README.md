recursion
==============

This is a project I completed with a pair as a student at Hack Reactor. We wrote polyfills for the following native JavaScript DOM methods:

- getElementByClassName
- stringifyJSON

### Testing

Tests are written with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the /spec directory. To run them, open the spec runner file with any browser.
